                <ol start="2">
                    <li>How did the site meet the needs of the visitor?</li>

                </ol>
                <ul type="square">
                    <li>The intent of this website caters to customers who are viewing sitting at home using either a desktop or laptop, laying in bed, or quite possibly someone who is strictly viewing on a smartphone because they do not have a computer yet.</li>

                    <li>The expectation of this website is that the visitor is looking for deals on good tech gear or high quality tech gear you cannot find anywhere else.</li>

                    <li>As long as the vistor lives in one of four geographic locations listed above there is no impact on the content delivery. However, they may have to change the language of the website below.</li>

                    <li>This website caters to visitors during all times in the day.</li>
                    <li>This website can be accessed by users through desktop machines, smart phones, and tablets.</li>
                </ul>
                <ol start="3">

                    <li>Describe how the content was organized to facilitate it being found.</li>
                </ol>
                <ul type="square">

                    <li>On the site the search bar was located in a location that is conventional, on the top of the web browser.</li>
                    <li>The banner below that includes a slideshow users can easily click for deals or new products.</li>
                    <li>Below that includes deals and recommended items based on what the users search history was.</li>
                    <li>Then we have thirteen categories organized in a button format. Making it simple for the user to be directed with just a click of a finger.</li>
                    <li>All of these items can be found on the home page of the web site, making it as easy as a site can be for mobile users.</li>
                </ul>
                    <ol start="4">
                        <li>What did the site do to make the mobile experience enjoyable (or at least not painful)?</li>
                    </ol>

                    <ul type="square">

                        <li>The site made everything within a touch of a button right on the homepage.</li>
                        <li>None of it felt cluttered because it utilized the ability to swipe left and right on some slideshow images, condensing the information.</li>

                    </ul>
                <ol start="5">
                
                <li>Did the site seem to facilitate people in a mobile environment (Think about the descriptions in the Visitor Considerations reading)? If "Yes", how?</li>
                
                </ol>
                
                <ul type="square">
                    <p>Yes, the site seemed to facilitate people in a mobile environment.</p>
                    <p>How?</p>
                    <li>The site has an easily accessible arrow button at the bottom of the page to help user return back to the top of the webpage.</li>
                    <li>The site has icons on the top right to aid with user browsing experience.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This image does a good job on meeting the users needs because right in the front home page is listed with great deals. Some of which are mobile exclusive deals and there is also a category for top selling items for easy browsing for the user.</p>

    <li>Did they or did they not know who their target audience was?</li>
     <p>They know who their target audience is because they have displayed men dressed up in wedding for their tailoring service.</p>
    </ol>
  
    <ol start="2">
    
        <li>Did they or did they not meet the needs of their audience?</li>
        <p>They did not meet the needs of their audience. As a viewer of their site, I found it difficult locating their purpose, even when I read their About section.</p>
    </ol>
    
    <ol start="3">
    <li>Did they or did they not organize content to facilitate it being found?</li>
    <p>They did not organize content to facilitate it being found. Viewing this website I was lost on the homepage because they have everything on one page. They have a slideshow with models wearing their clothing, products their selling, and blogs all on the same page.</p>
    </ol>
    
    <ol start="4">
    
    <li>Did the site facilitate visitors in a mobile environment?</li>
    <p>The site did not facilitate visitors in a mobile environment. First and foremost, the Menu button is so small that often times I am clicking the internet browsing bar and not the Menu button. When you finally click the Menu button, a tray slides out from the side of the site that is equally as small on my mobile device.</p>
