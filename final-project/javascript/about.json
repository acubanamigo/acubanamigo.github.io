        "Welcome": "Hello and welcome to my website. My name is R.J. Stawinski and I am a CIT major at BYU-Idaho. I made this website because over time whether serving in family home evening related church callings or simply trying to find related content, I would search on the internet for ideas. Yet, I never really found a site that I felt provided me with the content I was looking for. So without further ado welcome to my FHE site, Family Home Easy. Hopefully it provides you with enough resources to make your Family Home Evening as easy to plan as it should be!"
